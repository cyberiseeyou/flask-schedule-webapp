## **Overall UX Goals & Principles**

### **Target User Personas**

* **The Focused Scheduler**: A user whose primary responsibility is to efficiently and accurately schedule events. They value speed, clarity, and trust in the system to prevent errors. They are task-oriented and need a tool that gets out of their way and lets them get their work done.

### **Usability Goals**

* **Efficiency of Use**: The core workflow of selecting an event, a date, and an available employee should be achievable in under 30 seconds.  
* **Error Prevention**: The interface should proactively prevent users from making mistakes, such as scheduling an event outside its valid date range or double-booking an employee.  
* **High Confidence**: Schedulers should feel confident that the list of available employees is always accurate, eliminating the need for manual verification.

### **Design Principles**

1. **Clarity Above All**: The interface must be immediately understandable. Every piece of information should have a clear purpose.  
2. **One Task, One Screen**: The scheduling view should be hyper-focused on the single task of scheduling one event, minimizing distractions.  
3. **Provide Instant Feedback**: Actions, like selecting a date, should provide immediate and visible results, such as the employee list updating.

## **Information Architecture (IA)**

### **Site Map / Screen Inventory**

    A\[Dashboard '/'\] \--\> B\[Scheduling Page '/schedule/\<event\_id\>'\];

### **Navigation Structure**

* **Primary Navigation**: The primary navigation flow is linear: from the Dashboard, a user selects an event to navigate to the Scheduling Page. After submission, the user is returned to the Dashboard. There is no persistent global navigation bar required for this simple application.

## **User Flows**

### **Main Flow: Scheduling an Event**

* **User Goal**: To quickly and accurately schedule a pending event for an available employee.  
* **Entry Points**: The user starts the application and lands on the Dashboard.  
* **Success Criteria**: The user successfully saves a schedule, the event is removed from the dashboard list, and a new record exists in the database.

#### **Flow Diagram**

graph TD  
    A\[Start: View Dashboard\] \--\> B{Select an Event};  
    B \--\> C\[Navigate to Scheduling Page\];  
    C \--\> D\[Choose a Valid Date\];  
    D \--\> E\[System Fetches Available Employees\];  
    E \--\> F\[Select Employee & Start Time\];  
    F \--\> G\[Click 'Save Schedule'\];  
    G \--\> H{Validation};  
    H \-- Success \--\> I\[Save to Database & Update Event\];  
    I \--\> J\[Redirect to Dashboard\];  
    H \-- Failure \--\> K\[Show Error Message\];  
    K \--\> F;  
    J \--\> L\[End: Event is no longer in list\];

* **Edge Cases & Error Handling:**  
  * If no employees are available for a selected date, the dropdown should be disabled and show a message like "No employees available."  
  * If the form is submitted with an invalid date (e.g., manipulated on the frontend), the backend should reject it and show an error message.

## **Wireframes & Mockups**

* **Primary Design Files**: High-fidelity mockups and prototypes for this project would be developed in a tool like Figma and linked here.

### **Key Screen Layouts (Low-Fidelity)**

#### **Dashboard**

* **Purpose**: Display a prioritized list of unscheduled events.  
* **Key Elements**:  
  * Main Heading: "Unscheduled Events"  
  * A list or table of events. Each item displays:  
    * Event Name  
    * Valid Date Range (Start Date \- Due Date)  
    * A "Schedule" button.

#### **Scheduling Page**

* **Purpose**: To schedule a single selected event.  
* **Key Elements**:  
  * Main Heading: "Schedule: \[Event Name\]"  
  * Form Fields:  
    * Date Picker (labeled "Scheduled Date")  
    * Dropdown Menu (labeled "Available Employee")  
    * Time Input (labeled "Start Time")  
  * Action Buttons:  
    * "Save Schedule" (Primary)  
    * "Cancel" (Secondary, returns to dashboard)

## **Accessibility Requirements**

* **Compliance Target**: WCAG 2.1 Level AA.  
* **Key Requirements**:  
  * All form inputs must have clear, associated labels.  
  * Color contrast ratios for text and UI elements must meet the AA standard.  
  * The entire scheduling flow must be navigable and operable using only a keyboard.  
  * Focus indicators must be clearly visible on all interactive elements.
