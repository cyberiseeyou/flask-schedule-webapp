# Story 1.5: CSV Import/Export Functionality

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** scheduler,
**I want** to import unscheduled events from CSV files and export completed schedules to CSV,
**so that** I can efficiently manage bulk data operations and integrate with external systems.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A POST endpoint is created at /api/import/events that accepts multipart/form-data file uploads.
2. The system can parse WorkBankVisits.csv files and create Event records with proper field mapping.
3. The system populates the Employees table from unique Employee ID and Rep Name combinations during import.
4. Import operations use Project Reference Number to avoid duplicates and return count of imported events.
5. A GET endpoint is created at /api/export/schedule that returns a CSV file of scheduled events.
6. Export generates CalendarSchedule.csv with proper column headers and data from schedules, events, and employees tables.
7. Dashboard UI includes Import Events and Export Schedule buttons with proper file handling.

[Source: Fullstack Architecture Document.md#api-specification]

### Backend Implementation Requirements
**CSV Import Logic**:
1. Accept WorkBankVisits.csv file upload
2. First populate Employees table from unique Rep Name/Employee ID combinations
3. Parse CSV and map columns to Events data model
4. Use Project Reference Number to avoid duplicates
5. Return count of imported events

**CSV Export Logic**:
1. Query database with JOIN across schedules, events, employees tables
2. Generate CSV with CalendarSchedule.csv format headers
3. Return as downloadable file named CalendarSchedule.csv

### File Locations and Project Structure
**Backend Files**:
- Main route implementations: scheduler_app/app.py
- Database models: Already exist in scheduler_app/app.py

**Frontend Files**:
- UI integration: scheduler_app/templates/index.html (dashboard)
- JavaScript functionality: scheduler_app/static/js/main.js
- Styling: scheduler_app/static/css/style.css

**Testing Files**:
- Integration tests: scheduler_app/test_routes.py
[Source: Previous story patterns and architecture unified-project-structure]

### Technical Constraints
- **Flask Framework**: Use Flask file upload capabilities with request.files
- **CSV Processing**: Use Python's built-in csv module for parsing and generation
- **Database**: Use existing SQLAlchemy ORM patterns from previous stories
- **Error Handling**: Follow established flash message patterns for user feedback
- **Security**: Validate file types and content before processing
- **Performance**: Index on schedule_datetime already exists for export queries
[Source: Fullstack Architecture Document.md#tech-stack]

### Testing Standards
**Testing Framework**: Pytest 7.4+
**Test Location**: Tests should be added to scheduler_app/test_routes.py
**Test Standards**: 
- Unit tests for CSV parsing logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- File upload simulation tests
- Database operation tests with rollback
- Error scenario coverage (invalid files, malformed data)
- Follow existing test patterns from TestScheduleSaving class
[Source: Previous story testing patterns and architecture testing-strategy]

### Security Considerations
- Validate uploaded files are CSV format
- Sanitize CSV data before database insertion
- Limit file upload size to prevent abuse
- Use SQLAlchemy ORM to prevent SQL injection
- Validate CSV column headers match expected format
[Source: Fullstack Architecture Document.md#security-and-performance]

### Performance Considerations
- Use database transactions for import operations to ensure atomicity
- Batch insert operations for large CSV files
- Existing index on schedule_datetime supports export queries
- Stream CSV generation for large exports to manage memory
