# Story 1.3: Employee Availability API

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** frontend developer,
**I want** an API endpoint that returns available employees for a specific date,
**so that** I can dynamically populate the employee dropdown menu.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A GET endpoint is created at /api/available_employees/<date>.
2. When the endpoint is called with a valid date (e.g., 2025-10-30), it returns a JSON response.
3. The JSON response is a list of all employees who do not have an entry in the Schedules table for that specific date.
4. Each employee in the JSON list includes their id and name.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create API endpoint route (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Implement GET /api/available_employees/<date> route in app.py
  - [x] Add proper date parameter validation and parsing
  - [x] Import required modules (jsonify, request validation)
  - [x] Handle invalid date format with 400 error response
- [x] Task 2: Implement availability business logic (AC: 3)
  - [x] Query all employees from Employees table
  - [x] Query scheduled employees for the specific date from Schedules table
  - [x] Filter out employees who are already scheduled on that date
  - [x] Return list of available employees
- [x] Task 3: Format JSON response (AC: 4)
  - [x] Serialize employee data to JSON format
  - [x] Include only id and name fields in response
  - [x] Return proper Content-Type: application/json header
  - [x] Handle empty results (no available employees)
- [x] Task 4: Error handling and validation
  - [x] Validate date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - [x] Handle malformed date parameters
  - [x] Return appropriate HTTP status codes
  - [x] Add proper error messages for invalid requests
- [x] Task 5: Testing implementation
  - [x] Write unit tests for date validation logic
  - [x] Test employee availability filtering
  - [x] Test JSON response format
  - [x] Integration tests for complete API workflow
  - [x] Test edge cases (no employees, all employees scheduled)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.2 successfully implemented:

### API Specifications
**Endpoint Definition:**
- **Path**: /api/available_employees/<date>
- **Method**: GET
- **URL Parameter**: date (string, format: YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Response Format**: JSON array of employee objects
- **Response Schema**:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "name": "string"
    }
  ]
  ```
- **Status Codes**: 200 (success), 400 (invalid date format)

### Data Models Context
**Employees Model:**
- id: String, Primary Key (from Employee ID)
- name: String (from Rep Name)
[Source: Fullstack Architecture Document.md#data-models]

**Schedules Model:**
- id: Integer, Primary Key
- event_ref_num: Integer, Foreign Key (Events.project_ref_num)
- employee_id: String, Foreign Key (Employees.id)
- schedule_datetime: DateTime (from Schedule Date/Time)
[Source: Fullstack Architecture Document.md#data-models]

### Business Logic Requirements
**Availability Logic:**
- Query all employees from Employees table
- For the specified date, find all employee_ids in Schedules table with schedule_datetime on that date
- Return employees NOT in the scheduled list for that date
- Empty array is valid response if no employees available
[Source: PRD.md#acceptance-criteria]

### Technology Stack
- **Web Framework**: Flask 2.3+ (API endpoint creation)
- **Database ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0+ (employee and schedule queries)
- **Response Format**: JSON (Flask jsonify)
- **Testing Framework**: Pytest 7.4+ (API endpoint testing)
[Source: Fullstack Architecture Document.md#tech-stack]

### Project Structure
Files to modify/create:
- `scheduler_app/app.py` (add API endpoint route)
- `scheduler_app/test_routes.py` (add API endpoint tests)
[Source: Fullstack Architecture Document.md#unified-project-structure]

### Functional Requirements
- **FR3**: API endpoint that returns available employees for a specific date
- **NFR2**: Use Flask web framework for API implementation
- **NFR3**: Use SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM for data access
[Source: PRD.md#requirements]

### Testing Standards
**Testing Framework**: Pytest 7.4+
**Test Location**: Add tests to existing scheduler_app/test_routes.py
**Test Standards:**
- Unit tests for date validation and business logic
- Integration tests for complete API workflow
- Test edge cases (invalid dates, no available employees)
- Follow existing testing patterns from previous stories
[Source: Fullstack Architecture Document.md#tech-stack, Story 1.2 implementation pattern]

### Security Considerations
- Input validation for date parameter format
- SQL injection prevention through ORM usage
- Proper HTTP status codes for error conditions
- No sensitive data exposure in API responses
[Source: Previous story security patterns]

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient database queries with proper joins
- Minimize N+1 query issues
- Index on schedule_datetime already exists from previous story
- Consider date range queries for optimization
