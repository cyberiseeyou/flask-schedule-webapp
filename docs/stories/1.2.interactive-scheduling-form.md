# Story 1.2: Interactive Scheduling Form

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** scheduler,
**I want** to click on an event from the dashboard and be taken to a dedicated scheduling page,
**so that** I can focus on scheduling that single event.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Each event on the dashboard has a "Schedule" button or link.
2. Clicking the "Schedule" link navigates to /schedule/<event_id>.
3. The scheduling page displays the name of the selected event.
4. The page contains a date picker input field.
5. Using JavaScript, the date picker is constrained to only allow dates between the event's start_date and due_date.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Add Schedule buttons to dashboard (AC: 1)
  - [x] Modify index.html template to include Schedule button for each event
  - [x] Style Schedule buttons according to UI specification (Primary color #007BFF)

- [x] Task 2: Create scheduling page route (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Implement /schedule/<event_id> route in app.py
  - [x] Query event by ID and pass to template
  - [x] Handle case where event_id doesn't exist (404 error)
  - [x] Display event name prominently on scheduling page
- [x] Task 3: Create scheduling page template (AC: 3, 4)
  - [x] Create schedule.html template in templates/ directory
  - [x] Include event name in page heading: "Schedule: [Event Name]"
  - [x] Add date picker input field labeled "Scheduled Date"
  - [x] Apply consistent styling with dashboard page
  - [x] Include Cancel button that returns to dashboard
- [x] Task 4: Implement date constraints with JavaScript (AC: 5)
  - [x] Add JavaScript to main.js for date picker constraints
  - [x] Set min date to event's start_datetime
  - [x] Set max date to event's due_datetime
  - [x] Pass event dates from backend to frontend (JSON in template)
  - [x] Ensure date picker only allows valid date range
- [x] Task 5: Testing implementation
  - [x] Write unit tests for scheduling route
  - [x] Test event retrieval and 404 handling
  - [x] Test date constraint JavaScript functionality
  - [x] Integration test for full dashboard-to-scheduling navigation

### Routing and Navigation Structure
**Primary Navigation Flow:**
- Linear flow: Dashboard → Scheduling Page → Dashboard (after completion)
- No persistent global navigation bar required
- "Cancel" button provides way back to dashboard
[Source: UI_UX SPECIFICATION.md#navigation-structure]

### Data Model Context
**Events Model Fields (relevant for this story):**
- id: Integer, Primary Key (for route parameter)
- project_name: String (display on scheduling page)
- start_datetime: DateTime (min date constraint)
- due_datetime: DateTime (max date constraint)
[Source: Fullstack Architecture Document.md#data-models]

### Project Structure
Files to modify/create:
- `scheduler_app/templates/index.html` (add Schedule buttons)
- `scheduler_app/templates/schedule.html` (create scheduling page)
- `scheduler_app/app.py` (add /schedule/<event_id> route)
- `scheduler_app/static/js/main.js` (date picker constraints)
- `scheduler_app/static/css/style.css` (styling updates)
[Source: Fullstack Architecture Document.md#unified-project-structure]

### Functional Requirements
- **FR2**: Provide dedicated, interactive scheduling form for each event
- **NFR4**: Frontend with standard HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no heavy frameworks)
- Date picker must enforce business rule constraints (start_date to due_date)
[Source: PRD.md#requirements]

### Technology Stack
- **Web Framework**: Flask 2.3+ (route handling)
- **Frontend**: HTML5/CSS3, JavaScript ES6+ (date picker functionality)
- **Database ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0+ (event queries)
[Source: Fullstack Architecture Document.md#tech-stack]

### Testing Standards
**Testing Framework**: Pytest 7.4+
**Test Location**: Create tests in scheduler_app/ directory
**Test Standards:**
- Unit tests for route logic and JavaScript date constraints
- Integration tests for navigation flow and event retrieval
- Follow testing pyramid approach
[Source: PRD.md#technical-assumptions, Story 1.1 implementation pattern]

### Accessibility Requirements
- All form inputs must have clear, associated labels
- Focus indicators must be clearly visible on interactive elements
- Entire scheduling flow must be keyboard navigable
- Color contrast ratios must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standard
[Source: UI_UX SPECIFICATION.md#accessibility-requirements]

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-23

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**EXCELLENT** - This is a high-quality implementation that demonstrates strong engineering practices. The code is clean, well-structured, and follows established patterns. All acceptance criteria are fully met with comprehensive test coverage.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: scheduler_app/app.py
  - **Change**: Updated `Event.query.get(event_id)` to `db.session.get(Event, event_id)`
  - **Why**: SQLAlchemy 2.0 best practices - Query.get() is deprecated
  - **How**: Eliminates legacy API warnings and future-proofs the codebase

- **File**: scheduler_app/test_routes.py
  - **Change**: Updated test route to use `db.session.get(Event, event_id)`
  - **Why**: Consistency with main application code
  - **How**: Maintains test-production parity and eliminates warnings

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ **EXCELLENT** - Clean, readable code with proper separation of concerns
- Project Structure: ✓ **EXCELLENT** - Files placed in correct locations per architecture spec
- Testing Strategy: ✓ **EXCELLENT** - Comprehensive test coverage (8 route + 6 model tests)
- All ACs Met: ✓ **PERFECT** - Every acceptance criterion fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Refactored SQLAlchemy API usage for 2.0 compatibility (app.py, test_routes.py)
- [x] Verified comprehensive test coverage for all new functionality
- [x] Validated accessibility compliance (proper labels, ARIA attributes)
- [x] Confirmed responsive design implementation
- [x] Checked error handling robustness (404 cases)

**All items completed - no outstanding issues identified**

### Security Review

**PASS** - No security concerns identified:
- Proper input validation through Flask route parameters
- No SQL injection vectors (using ORM)
- 404 error handling prevents information disclosure
- No sensitive data exposed in client-side code
- CSRF protection not required for read-only operations

### Performance Considerations

**PASS** - Performance is appropriate for scope:
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Minimal JavaScript footprint
- Responsive CSS with mobile-first approach
- No N+1 query issues
- Proper caching headers via Flask defaults

### Files Modified During Review

- scheduler_app/app.py (SQLAlchemy API modernization)
- scheduler_app/test_routes.py (test consistency fix)

### Requirements Traceability

**Perfect AC Coverage:**
- **AC1**: Schedule buttons → `index.html` template + `style.css` styling ✓
- **AC2**: Navigation to /schedule/<event_id> → Flask route in `app.py` ✓  
- **AC3**: Event name display → `schedule.html` template rendering ✓
- **AC4**: Date picker field → HTML5 date input with accessibility ✓
- **AC5**: JavaScript constraints → `main.js` validation with visual feedback ✓

### Gate Status
