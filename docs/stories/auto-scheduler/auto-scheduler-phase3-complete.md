## Architecture Compliance

From `docs/auto-scheduler-architecture.md`:

âœ… **Propose-Approve Workflow** - No auto-execution without review
âœ… **Service Layer Separation** - Routes delegate to services
âœ… **RESTful API Design** - Clean URL structure
âœ… **User Confirmation** - Approval dialog before execution
âœ… **Transaction Safety** - Rollback on errors
âœ… **Status Tracking** - SchedulerRunHistory records

---

## Browser Compatibility

**Completed by:** Winston, Architect (YOLO Mode Still Activated ðŸ”¥)
**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Next Session:** Phase 4 - Crossmark API Integration
**Estimated Time for Phase 4:** 1-2 weeks (or 30 minutes in YOLO mode ðŸ˜Ž)

## Lessons Learned

**What Went Well:**
- Clear architecture document made implementation trivial
- Service layer abstraction kept routes clean
- Existing template patterns accelerated UI development
- AJAX workflow provides smooth UX
- Color-coded sections improve usability

**Technical Debt Created:**
- Edit functionality is placeholder (needs modal)
- No pagination on large result sets
- No WebSocket for real-time progress
- Client-side rendering could be moved to server
- JavaScript should be in separate .js files

**To Address in Phase 4:**
- Implement edit modal with datetime picker
- Add table pagination/sorting
- Extract JavaScript to modules
- Add loading skeletons instead of spinners
- Implement proper form validation
