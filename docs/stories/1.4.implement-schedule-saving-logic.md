# Story 1.4: Implement Schedule Saving Logic

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** scheduler,
**I want** to select a date, an available employee, and a time, then save the schedule,
**so that** the event is successfully scheduled and removed from my to-do list.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. On the scheduling page, selecting a date triggers a JavaScript call to the availability API and populates the "Employee" dropdown.
2. The form can be submitted via a POST request to /save_schedule.
3. The backend validates that the submitted scheduled_date is within the event's start_date and due_date.
4. If valid, a new record is created in the Schedules table with the correct event_id, employee_id, scheduled_date, and start_time.
5. The corresponding record in the Events table has its is_scheduled flag set to True.
6. After a successful save, the user is redirected back to the dashboard, which no longer shows the event that was just scheduled.

### API Specifications
**Schedule Saving Endpoint:**
- **Path**: /save_schedule
- **Method**: POST
- **Request Format**: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
- **Request Schema**:
  ```
  event_id: integer
  employee_id: string (matches Employee.id from database)
  scheduled_date: string (format: YYYY-MM-DD)
  start_time: string (time format)
  ```
- **Response**: 302 redirect to dashboard on success
- **Error Handling**: Validation errors should return appropriate error messages

### Data Models Context
**Events Model:**
- id: Integer, Primary Key
- project_name: Text, not null
- project_ref_num: Integer, not null, unique
- start_datetime: DateTime, not null (used for date range validation)
- due_datetime: DateTime, not null (used for date range validation)  
- is_scheduled: Boolean, not null, default False (to be updated to True)
[Source: Fullstack Architecture Document.md#data-models]

**Employees Model:**
- id: String, Primary Key (from Employee ID)
- name: String (from Rep Name)
[Source: Fullstack Architecture Document.md#data-models]

**Schedules Model:**
- id: Integer, Primary Key
- event_ref_num: Integer, Foreign Key (Events.project_ref_num)
- employee_id: String, Foreign Key (Employees.id)
- schedule_datetime: DateTime (from Schedule Date/Time)
[Source: Fullstack Architecture Document.md#data-models]

### Business Logic Requirements
**Schedule Saving Logic:**
- Validate scheduled_date is between event's start_datetime and due_datetime
- Create Schedule record with event's project_ref_num (not event.id)
- Combine scheduled_date and start_time into schedule_datetime
- Update Events.is_scheduled to True for the scheduled event
- Use database transactions for data consistency
- Redirect to dashboard after successful save
[Source: PRD.md#acceptance-criteria]

### Technology Stack
- **Web Framework**: Flask 2.3+ (POST route handling and form processing)
- **Database ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0+ (database transactions and model updates)
- **Frontend Scripting**: JavaScript ES6+ (AJAX calls and DOM manipulation)
- **Form Handling**: HTML5 forms with Flask request handling
- **Testing Framework**: Pytest 7.4+ (backend route and database testing)
[Source: Fullstack Architecture Document.md#tech-stack]

### Project Structure
Files to modify/create:
- `scheduler_app/app.py` (add /save_schedule POST route)
- `scheduler_app/static/js/main.js` (add date picker change handler and AJAX)
- `scheduler_app/templates/schedule.html` (ensure form structure is complete)
- `scheduler_app/test_routes.py` (add schedule saving tests)
[Source: Fullstack Architecture Document.md#unified-project-structure]

### Functional Requirements
- **FR5**: System validates and saves new schedule to database with event ID, employee ID, chosen date, and start time
- **FR6**: Upon successful save, system updates corresponding event's is_scheduled flag to True
- **NFR2**: Use Flask web framework for POST route implementation
- **NFR3**: Use SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM for data access and transactions
[Source: PRD.md#requirements]

### Testing Standards
**Testing Framework**: Pytest 7.4+
**Test Location**: Add tests to existing scheduler_app/test_routes.py
**Test Standards:**
- Unit tests for date validation and form processing logic
- Integration tests for complete schedule saving workflow
- Test database transaction handling and rollback scenarios
- Test JavaScript functionality with appropriate mocking
- Test edge cases (invalid dates, missing data, database errors)
- Follow existing testing patterns from previous stories
[Source: Fullstack Architecture Document.md#tech-stack, Story 1.3 implementation pattern]

### Security Considerations
- Backend validation for all form inputs to prevent invalid data submission
- Date range validation to ensure scheduled_date is within event constraints
- SQL injection prevention through SQLAlchemy ORM usage
- Proper error handling without exposing sensitive system information
- Form CSRF protection considerations for production deployment
[Source: Fullstack Architecture Document.md#security-and-performance]

### Performance Considerations
- Database transactions to ensure atomicity of schedule creation and event update
- Efficient database queries using existing indexes
- Minimize database round trips by batching related operations
- JavaScript optimization for smooth user experience during AJAX calls
- Index on schedule_datetime already exists from previous story
