nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Date validation with try/except prevents injection. Error messages are user-friendly without exposing internals. Authentication likely enforced via existing decorator.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Reuses existing PDF generation logic. No performance degradation. Date parsing is efficient.'
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Code duplication increases maintenance burden and risk of divergence. Error handling is adequate with try/except and logging.'
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Incomplete refactoring creates two implementations of same logic. Future changes must be made in two places. Violates DRY principle.'
