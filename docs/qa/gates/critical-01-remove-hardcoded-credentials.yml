# Quality Gate Decision: CRITICAL-01 - Remove Hardcoded Credentials
ticket: CRITICAL-01
title: Remove Hardcoded Credentials from Config
epic: Security
status: PASS_WITH_CONDITIONS
decision_date: 2025-01-09
reviewer: Quinn (QA Agent)

# Gate Decision
decision: PASS_WITH_CONDITIONS
rationale: |
  Implementation successfully removes hardcoded credentials and implements validation.
  Code changes are production-ready. However, user actions are required before
  marking ticket as fully complete:
  1. Credential rotation with Walmart administrator (URGENT)
  2. Git history audit for credential exposure

risk_level: MEDIUM_REMAINING
# Original risk: CRITICAL
# After implementation: MEDIUM (credentials exposed in git history until rotated)
# After user actions: LOW

# Requirements Traceability
acceptance_criteria:
  - id: AC-01

        clear error messages. Exempts testing environment correctly.

    - area: Error Messages
      rating: EXCELLENT
      details: |
        ValueError message includes list of missing variables and references
        .env.example - very helpful for developers.

    - area: Documentation
      rating: EXCELLENT
      details: |
        environment-variables.md is comprehensive (301 lines) covering:
        - Setup instructions for dev/prod
        - Security best practices
        - Troubleshooting guide
        - Credential rotation procedure
        - Cloud platform examples (AWS, Azure, GCP)

    - area: .env.example
      rating: GOOD
      details: |
        All required variables included with clear comments.
        Includes helpful note about generating encryption keys.

# Testing Assessment
testing:
  unit_tests:
    status: MANUAL_TESTING_ONLY
    details: |
      Testing checklist from ticket:
      ✓ Application starts without errors when env vars set
      ✓ Application raises clear error when env vars missing
      ✓ .env file is ignored by git
      ✓ .env.example is committed to repo
      ✓ Documentation is clear and complete

    recommendation: |
      Create automated tests:
      - test_config_validation_fails_without_credentials()
      - test_config_loads_with_valid_credentials()
      - test_testing_env_skips_validation()

  integration_tests:
    status: NOT_APPLICABLE

  security_tests:
    status: PENDING_USER_ACTION
    recommendation: |
      After credential rotation:
      - Verify old credentials no longer work
      - Test new credentials with EDR service
      - Confirm no credentials in git log

# Risk Assessment
risks:
  - id: RISK-01
    description: Exposed credentials still valid in Walmart system
    probability: HIGH
    impact: CRITICAL
    mitigation: USER MUST rotate credentials immediately
    status: OPEN

  - id: RISK-02
    description: Credentials visible in git history
    probability: HIGH
    impact: HIGH
    mitigation: |
      Git history remains unchanged. Rotating credentials invalidates
      historical exposure. Consider git history rewrite if needed.
    status: ACCEPTED

  - id: RISK-03
    description: Application fails to start if credentials not set
    probability: MEDIUM
    impact: MEDIUM
    mitigation: Clear error message guides developers to fix
    status: MITIGATED

# Non-Functional Requirements
nfr_validation:
  - attribute: Security
    requirement: No hardcoded credentials in codebase
    status: PASS
    test_scenario: |
      Given the codebase is scanned
      When searching for hardcoded credential patterns
      Then no credentials with default values are found

  - attribute: Usability
    requirement: Clear developer setup instructions
    status: PASS
    test_scenario: |
      Given a new developer joins the team
      When they follow environment-variables.md
      Then they can set up credentials successfully

  - attribute: Reliability
    requirement: Application fails fast with missing config
    status: PASS
    test_scenario: |
      Given required credentials are not set
      When application starts
      Then ValueError raised with clear guidance

# Technical Debt
technical_debt:
  - id: DEBT-01
    description: No automated tests for configuration validation
    severity: MEDIUM
    effort: 2-3 hours
    recommendation: Create tests in tests/unit/test_config.py

  - id: DEBT-02
    description: No secrets management integration (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets)
    severity: LOW
    effort: 8-12 hours
    recommendation: Implement for production deployment (future enhancement)

    ✓ Documentation includes security best practices

  pci_dss: IMPROVED
  details: |
    Requirement 8: Identify and authenticate access
    ✓ No credentials in version control

# Deployment Checklist
deployment:
  pre_deployment:
    - Rotate Walmart EDR credentials (USER ACTION)
    - Verify .env.example committed (✓ DONE)
    - Verify .env in .gitignore (✓ DONE)
    - Test application startup with credentials (✓ DONE)
    - Test application failure without credentials (✓ DONE)

  post_deployment:
    - Monitor application logs for configuration errors
    - Verify EDR service functionality with new credentials
    - Document credential rotation in security log
    - Schedule next rotation (90 days)

# Sign-off
gate_approval:
  qa_review: PASS_WITH_CONDITIONS
  qa_reviewer: Quinn (QA Agent)
  qa_date: 2025-01-09

  conditions:
    - User must rotate exposed Walmart EDR credentials before production deployment
    - Git history audit recommended but not blocking
    - Monitor first production deployment for configuration issues

  security_review: PENDING_USER_ACTION
  security_concerns: |
    Exposed credentials remain valid until rotated by user.
    This is the highest priority action item.

# Notes
notes: |
  Implementation quality is excellent. Code is production-ready.
  The blocking issue is external: user must coordinate with Walmart
  administrator to rotate credentials. This is documented clearly
  in the ticket and this gate decision.

  Recommend treating credential rotation as CRITICAL and completing
  within 24-48 hours of this review.
