- [ ] Remove the Splash Shield.
- [ ] Remove the upper cup by supporting it with one hand, pulling the pin toward you, and set it in an empty wash tub.
- [ ] Remove the two spanner nuts from the lower cup and place them in the wash tub.
- [ ] Remove the lower cup, being aware of the blade on the juicer manifold.
- [ ] In the wash tub, add HAWK Degreaser and warm water at a 1:90 ratio.
- [ ] Soak the parts for up to 15 minutes.
- [ ] **NOTE:** HAWK degreaser is very corrosive. Do NOT leave these parts soaking for more than 15 minutes.

- [ ] Remove the screw from the left side holding the manifold in place and put it in a separate clean tub.
- [ ] Remove the manifold and orifice tube and place them in the clean tub.

## Washing & Sanitizing
- [ ] Wash the strainer tube and orifice tube in proper dish washing solution.
- [ ] Use the orifice tube scrub brush to remove any pulp and debris from inside the tube.
- [ ] After the first soak is complete, remove the top and bottom cups, spray them off, and then let them soak in sanitizer solution for at least 90 seconds.
- [ ] While the cups are sanitizing, wash, rinse, and sanitize the remaining parts, ensuring they also remain in sanitizer for at least 90 seconds.

## Soaking (Part 2)
- [ ] Place the Juice Manifold, Strainer Tube, Spanner Nuts, Spanner Screw, Spanner Tool, Orifice Tube, and Juice Nozzle into the tub with HAWK degreaser and allow them to soak for 10-15 minutes.
